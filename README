This project is an update of the sample project described in the article
I published on Adobe Developer Connection in June 2008.

This version replaces SpringFactory with Spring BlazeDS Integration library.
Plus it integrates basic security with Spring Security, and it has a one-to-many relationship.

This project can be used to bootstrap Spring/Flex projects. That's why it's meant to remain
as simple and generic as possible.
